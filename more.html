    Animals are eukaryotic, multicellular, species belonging to the <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Animalia/">Kingdom Animalia</a>. Every animal has its own unique characteristics. They obtain their energy either by feeding on plants or on other animals. There are millions of species which have been identified, few share similar characteristics while others differ drastically.

  </div>
  <div class="para">
  <p class="paragraph">Animals are classified based on their characteristics. They are eminent from <a href="https://byjus.com/biology/algae/">algae</a>, plants, and fungus where rigid cell walls are absent. Some are also heterotrophic, in general, they digest their food within the internal chambers which again distinguish them from algae and plants. Another elite character of these species is that they are motile, except in certain life stages.</p> <br><br>

      <p>Amphibians start as aquatic larvae (tadpoles) with gills, but many species have adapted to bypass this stage.
They undergo metamorphosis from aquatic larvae to air-breathing adults with lungs.</p>

<div class="para">
  <p class="paragraph">
    A mammal is a fascinating vertebrate animal belonging to the class Mammalia.Mammals are distinguished by several other unique features. Hair is a typical mammalian feature, although in many whales it has disappeared except in the fetal stage. The mammalian lower jaw is hinged directly to the skull, instead of through a separate bone (the quadrate) as in all other vertebrates.

    The term fish is applied to a variety of vertebrates of several evolutionary lines. It describes a life-form rather than a taxonomic group.Fish have developed special senses, too. Because water transmits sounds, disperses chemicals, and conducts electricity better than air, fish rely less on their vision and more on their hearing, taste, and smell.
